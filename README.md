# selenium-automation-with-springboot-and-cucumber
This is an implementation of selenium ui automation using spring boot, cucumber and junit. This project is still in working progress, so come back soon. I plan to switch from using junit to use testng which has better test management feature than junit and also add more tests. so please stop by soon.
